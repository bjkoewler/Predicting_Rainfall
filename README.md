As part of the IBM AI Engineer Certification course in machine learning, this final project required the construction of several models, including 
* Linear Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines

Each model was fit to the training data and predicted rainfall for the next day. Scoring metrics including Jaccard Index, Accuracy Score, F1 Score, Log Loss, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R2 Score were calculated to compare the effectiveness of each model.
